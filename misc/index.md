The Outlook Add-in API subset of the JavaScript API for Office includes objects, methods, properties and events that you can use in an Outlook add-in.

## What are Outlook Add-ins?

Outlook add-ins (formerly called "apps for Outlook") are integrations built by 3rd parties into Outlook using the new web technologies based platform. Outlook add-ins have 3 key aspects:

*   The same add-in and business logic works across desktop Outlook for Windows and Mac, web (Office 365 and Outlook.com) and mobile.
*   Add-ins consist of a manifest, which describes how the add-in integrates into Outlook (eg a button or a task pane), and JavaScript/HTML code, which makes up the UI and business logic of the add-in.
*   Add-ins can be acquired from the Office store or side-loaded by end-users or administrators.
