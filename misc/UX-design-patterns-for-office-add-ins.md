# UX design patterns for Office Add-ins 

The design of your Office Add-in is an important element in the user experience. Add-ins that provide a clean, modern UX have greater adoption and user retention. To help you create a first-class user experience as you develop your add-in, we provide 

When designing Office Add-ins, the UX design of your add-in should provide compelling experiences that extend Office. To create a great add-in, your add-in should provide a first-run experience, a first-class UX experience, and smooth transitions between pages. Providing a clean, modern UX experience increases user retention and adoption of your add-in. This article presents UX resources for designers and developers that:

* Describe common UX design patterns based on best practices.
* Implement Office Fabric components and styles.
* Implement add-ins that look like a natural extension of the default Office UI. 

## How do I get started using the Office add-in design sample resources?

There are no prerequisites to use these design or code assets. To get started creating a great UX for your add-in:

* Review the UX design patterns, and identify which ones are important to your add-in. For example, pick one of the first-run experiences.
* Then do one or more of the following:
	* Copy the code files to your add-in project and start customizing them to meet your requirements. You will need the [common.js file](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/), the [assets folder](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/assets), and the code folder for the design pattern you need. See links below.
	* Download the reference PDFs and use them as a guide when creating your own UX design. See links below.
	* Download the Adobe Illustrator files and edit them to mock-up your own add-in designs. Get them [here](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/Source%20Files).
 

## First-Run

A first-run experience is the experience a user has when opening your add-in for the first time. The following lists the first run design patterns you can include in your add-in. Images of each of them are below.

* **Steps to start** provides users with an ordered list of steps to perform to get started using your add-in. ([PDF](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/FirstRun_StepsToStart.pdf "PDF"), [code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates/first-run/instruction-step))
* **Value** communicates your add-in's value proposition. ([PDF](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/FirstRun_ValuePlacemat.pdf "PDF"), [code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates/first-run/value-placemat))
* **Video** shows users a video before they start using your add-in. ([PDF](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/FirstRun_VideoPlacemat.pdf "PDF"), [code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates/first-run/video-placemat))
* **Walkthrough** takes users through a series of features or information before they start using the add-in. ([PDF](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/FirstRun_PagingPanel.pdf "PDF"), [code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates/first-run/walkthrough))
* The [Office Store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj220033.aspx) has a system for providing users with a trial version of an add-in, but if you want full control of the UI for a trial experience, use the following templates:
	* **Trial** shows users how to get started with a trial version of your add-in. ([PDF](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/FirstRun_TrialVersion.pdf "PDF"), [code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates/first-run/trial-placemat))
	* **Trial feature** advises users that the feature they are trying to use is not available in the trial version of the add-in. ([code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates/first-run/trial-placemat-feature))


> Note: Consider whether showing users the first-run experience once or many times is important to your scenario. For example, if users use your add-in periodically, they may forget how to use the add-in. Seeing the first-run experience again may be helpful to those users.

## Generic and Branding

* **Landing page** is the first place users navigate to after the first-run experience or after a sign-in process. ([PDF](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Helpful%20Templates/AddIn_Template_Standard_Layout.pdf "PDF"), [code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates/generic/landing-page))

 </table>

## Notifications

There are a variety of ways that your add-in can notify users of events, such as errors, or of progress. The following lists these techniques. Images of each of them are below.

* **Embedded dialog**  shows a dialog inside the task pane that provides information and, optionally, an interactive experience, using buttons or other controls. Consider using one to prompt a user to confirm an action. ([PDF](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/Embedded_Dialog.pdf "PDF") , [code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates/notifications/embedded-dialog))
* **Inline message** indicates error, success, or information, and it can appear at a specified location in the task pane. For example, if a user enters an improperly formatted email address in a text box, an error message appears just below the text box. ([PDF](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/Notification_Inline_Message.pdf "PDF"), [code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates/notifications/inline-message))
* **Message banner** provides information and, optionally, a simple call to action, in a banner that can be collapsed to a single line, expanded to multiple lines, or dismissed. Consider using message banners to report a service update or a helpful tip when the add-in starts. ([PDF](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/Notification_messagebanner.pdf "PDF"), [code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates/notifications/message-banner))
* **Progress bar** indicates the progress of a long-running, synchronous process, such as a configuration task that must complete before the user can take any further action. It is a separate interstitial page that also reinforces the add-in brand. Use a progress bar when the process can send periodic measures of how far along it is back to the add-in. ([PDF](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/Notification_progress.pdf "PDF"), [code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates/notifications/progress-bar))
* **Spinner** indicates that a long-running, synchronous process is underway, but provides no indication of how far along it is. It is a separate interstitial page that also reinforces the add-in brand. Use a spinner when the add-in cannot know reliably how far along a process is. ([PDF](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/Notification_progress.pdf "PDF"), [code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates/notifications/spinner))
* **Toast** provides a brief message that fades away after a few seconds. Since the user might not see the message, use toast only for inessential information. It is a good choice for notifying users of an event in a remote system, such as the receipt of an email. ([PDF](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/Notification_toast.pdf "PDF"), [code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates/notifications/toast))

## Known issues

* Running some code files outside of an add-in project throws a JavaScript error. 
	* Resolution: Ensure you add these files to an Office add-in project.
